# P8Checkers
Written in Prog8 language Polish Checkers game for 8-bit Commander X16 machine.

Polish Checkers aka International draughts is a very similar game to American checkers. The main differences from English draughts are: the size of the board (10Ã—10), pieces can also capture backward (not only forward), the long-range moving and capturing capability of kings known as flying, and the requirement that the maximum number of men be captured whenever a player has capturing options.
